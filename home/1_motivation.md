# 1. Motivation

Cloud computing is both a need and a wish that has come true.
I consider cloud computing as a replacement from infrastructure that was hard is hard to handle.

- Cloud computing has democratized app development, of any scales.

###### Here's an excerpt from a post I made:
> ⬇️ Creating a software company has become very approacheable - cloud computing

>  Netflix active monthly users - 182 million
Netflix uses AWS entirely for infrastructure. Proof: https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/case-studies/netflix/#:~:text=Netflix%20uses%20AWS%20for%20nearly,100%2C000%20server%20instances%20on%20AWS.
>Netflix spends 10-30 million $ per month on AWS.

> Cost of running servers per person = 1/6 = 0.166 $

> Setting up infrastructure is was the hard part in the past. It needed special teams, land.

> But this is not the case anymore. Anyone can set up massive infrastructure by the click of a button.

> So only development (including testing, deployment) remains to be done by the person, now.
> In short, cloud computing has democratized enterprise software creation, https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2019/08/27/how-cloud-computing-is-democratizing-development-and-accelerating-innovation/

> Let's run a simple example of how profitable this is.
> If the monthly cost of your service is Rs 10, and you have say 1 million users.
> You earn: 1e7 (1cr), but have to pay only around 0.016 cr for the servers.
> Gain: (10 - 1/6)/10 x 100 = 100 - 1.6 = 98.4%

> My opinion: today's time is the best time to make your own enterprise, and there's lots of scope for software. 😃
